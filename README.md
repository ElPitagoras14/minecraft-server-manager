# Minecraft Server Manager

> [!Warning]
> This project is still in development and is not ready for production use.

## Description

This is a Minecraft Server Manager that allows you to manage your Minecraft servers using docker containers for each server and a queue to start or stop servers. The server image documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server).

It consists of three core components:

- **Server Manager API** - A backend service built with Node.js and Express that provides a REST API for managing Minecraft servers through docker integration.
- **Server Manager Web** - A frontend application built with Next.js that provides a user interface for managing Minecraft servers and users.
- **Server Manager Discord Bot** - A Discord bot built with Discord.js that provides a Discord integration for simple managing Minecraft servers.

## Getting Started

> [!Important]
> Rename .env.example to .env and fill it. Rename docker-compose.yaml.example to docker-compose.yaml and change according your needs. Ensure that you fill environment variables on .env and docker-compose.yaml files at the root of the project.
